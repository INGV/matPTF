function elpt = ellipsedata(covmat,center,numpoints,sigmarule,varargin)
%% Ellipsedata V1.001
%
% Construct data points of ellipses representing contour curves of Gaussian
% distributions with any covariance and mean value.
%
%% Example
%
% In this example, the funcion ellipsedata constructs three ellipses of 100
% points each representing the contour curves corresponding to standard deviations
% of 1, 2 and 3 for a Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix given by
% [4,1;1,1] and mean value given by [3,3].
%
% elpt=ellipsedata([4,1;1,1],[3,3],100,[1,2,3]);
%
% The results can be plot as follows
%
% plot(elpt(:,1:2:end),elpt(:,2:2:end));
%
%% Input arguments
%
%   covmat:
%       Covariance matrix of a bivariate Gaussian distribution. Must be of
%       size 2x2, symmetric and positive definite. If the format is not
%       correct, an error is triggered. If the matrix is not symmetric, it
%       is symmetrized by adding its transpose and dividing by 2.
%
%   center:
%       The center (mean value) of the bivariate Gaussian distribution. If
%       the format is not correct, it is set to [0,0].
%
%   numpoints:
%       The number of points that each ellipse will be composed of. Must be
%       a positive integer number. If it is not numeric or positive, it is
%       set to 100. If it is not integer, it is converted to integer using
%       the function ceil.
%
%   sigmarule:
%       Vector of real numbers indicating the proportion of standard
%       deviation surrounded by each ellipse.
%
%   varargin (later assigned to "zeroprecision"):
%       A real number indicating the maximum difference after which two
%       numbers are considered different. This value is used for assessing
%       whether covmat is symmetric. If not specified, it is set to 1E-12
%
%% Output arguments
%
%   elpt:
%       Matrix in which each consecutive pair of columns represent an
%       ellipse corresponding to a different value of sigmarule, in the
%       order they were given in the input.
%
%% Version control
%
% V1.001: Changes are: (1) Previous version trigger an error if the matrix was not
% symmetric. In this version, if the matrix is not symmetric, it is
% symmetrized. (2) The last input argument is assigned to a variable called
% "zeroprecision" which controls the extent to which two numbers are
% considered different or equal. This value is used to assess whether
% covmat is symmetric or not.
